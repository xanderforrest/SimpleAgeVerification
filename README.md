<h1>A simple age verification plugin created for a small survival server.</h1>

If a player enters their age as below a threshold (currently 16), they are immediately banned.
<p>
In the future this could be expanded to enable configurable question/responses and subsequent actions.

<h3>TODO</h3>
<ul>Separate config file from storage of unverified players</ul>
<ul>Add simple config options for age threshold/messages</ul>
<ul>Add option for configurable action responses (i.e. kick/ban/tempban/mute</ul>
<ul>Add options for and processing of text responses</ul>
